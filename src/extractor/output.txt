             COMPUTER VIRUSES 
             Although the term “viruses” is often misapplied to all infections computers may 
             suffer, in reality, it specifically refers to a program that is commonly attached to 
             another program (e.g., Word Document or spreadsheet) and can replicate itself. 
             Every time the program is run, the viru s replicates itself, attached to a new 
             document. In time, a virus can completely bog a computer down to a crawl. 
             Viruses may also infect a boot  sector or partition sector. In some cases, these latter 
             viruses corrupt the sectors, making it impossible to reboot the computer. 
             Sometimes viruses have built-in timers. They await a specific date and time, then do 
             a predetermined task like complete ly erasing your hard drive. 
             A common way to pick up these viruses is by loading someone else’s infected files 
             into your system or loading an infected file off the Internet. 
             Email viruses are somewhat di fferent. They spread through email. You are typically 
             asked to open an attachment that will contain the virus. 
             Only by having an up-to-date virus scanner and being very careful how you handle 
             unknown files can you be reasonably confident your computer is safe. 
              
             COMPUTER WORMS 
             Worms are unable to replicate within a comp uter; instead, they replicate by being 
             passed from one computer to another, either via a vulnerabilities in the system or 
             via email. Like the computer virus, they can do a great deal of damage to a 
             computer they infect. Except for being unable to replicate within a computer, they 
             behave much like viruses and can be every bit as damaging. 
             Also like the viruses, you can only feel relatively safe if you use a current update of a 
             good anti-virus software, and if you are very careful about what programs you 
             download and what email attachments you open. 
              
             TROJAN HORSES 
             Trojan horses enter your system by invitation. Typically, they present themselves as 
             something they are NOT– a game perhaps. Once in your system, many Trojan 
             horses send information about your computer to remote locations. Hackers use these 
             “back door” Trojan horses to gain access to your system. 
              
             HACKERS AND CRACKERS 
             Hackers (breaking and entering your system) portray themselves as different from 
             Crackers (also steal or do damage). Most people do not make such a distinction. 
             Most see little distinction between entering your home and handling all of your 
             personal items and entering your home, handling all of your personal items, and 
             stealing some of them. 
             Hackers have a number of methods for finding and accessing your computer. They 
             might mass mail a Trojan horse, but they can  also just run programs that ping all of 
             the possible IP addresses. If your computer  is exposed and answers, the hacker may 
             take his or her time breaking into your system. Computers have scores of portals 
             exposed to the Ethernet. Many of them can be easily breeched. A hacker with your 
             IP address can simply explore all of the ports until he or she finds one that is open. If 
             you do not have good security, breaking into your system can be very easy indeed! 
             Once in your system, hackers may browse your files for private information about 
             you and/or your credit. But they may as easily create hidden directories within your 
             computer that permit them to store (a nd even deliver) pornography or other 
             information they do not want connected to their systems. Once in your system, 
             hackers frequently use it to attack other systems. A hack attack on a computer will 
             often pass through several "zombies" on its way. 
             Another common use hackers can have for your computer is Denial of Service (DOS) 
          attacks on other systems. These attacks are designed to interrupt communication in 
          larger systems. For example, when hack ers have accumulated enough computers, 
          they might have them all simultaneously ping the server in a corporation as often as 
          they are capable. The computer being ping ed, forced to simultaneously answer the 
          pings and becomes useless. Even computers with firewalls that protect them from 
          the pinging are forced to produce a report  for each ping – thousands of reports for 
          thousands of pings every few seconds. Since it is your computer and not the 
          hacker’s, you are the one the authorities find and question. 
          Computers attached to DSL connections, cable modems, or the Ethernet are 
          particularly vulnerable to hacking and should be protected with up-to-date firewalls. 
           
          SPYWARE 
          Spyware is a program that works much like a Trojan horse. People (often shareware 
          authors) insert spyware into innocent looking programs and people load the files that 
          contain the programs onto their computers. Once on your computer, the spyware will 
          track your movements and purchasing patterns on the Internet. Companies collect 
          the information and sell it as marketing databases. 
          Spyware that collects only statistical information is not illegal. Nonetheless, when 
          you have spyware loaded, you are serving information from your computer to a 
          remote location. It can be removed by specialized spyware removal programs. 
           
          CRASHES 
          Viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and hackers can destroy your system with no notice. 
          Furthermore, as your operating system becomes older, it tends to become buggy, 
          and it can shut down. Technically speaking, "crashing" a computer refers to the hard 
          drive failing, but it can also mean a board burning up. Over time, it has come to 
          mean any time your computer shuts down without notice. 
          You should assume that your computer is going to crash. Maybe you get hacked and 
          your computer ruined, or your copy of PhotoShop overloads the system and shuts 
          you down, or maybe you suffer a brownout. It does not matter much why the system 
          shuts down, the question is how do you protect yourself?
